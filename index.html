    <h1>Have you ever made a pizza from scratch?</h1>
    <h2>Yeah, but like have you really thought about it?</h2>
    <h3>Like, how if you put the sauce on first, before you make the base it doesn't work?</h3>
    <h4>Or if you put the cheese on then the sauce it's messed up too.</h4>

    <p>Making a pizza is similar to coding. There are
        certain things we have to do first. Like making the
        base, letting it rise, mould the base out, add the
        sauce, add the toppings, add the cheese, bake, and cut
        and serve. Not all pizzas end up the same, but they do
        start out in the same way as long as you follow the
        order correctly. You can have everything you need to
        make many different pizzas using the same base
        structure that is set up before hand.</p>
    <h5 class="special">This is how you make a pizza</h5>
    <p><small>There are some specific steps you need to take to make a pizza, we will list them here</small></p>
